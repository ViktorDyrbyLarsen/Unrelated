Use the template hyperbolic.c to implement the function. 

The file test.c implements a simple program that you can use to test your code. First, compile the program using make: 

$ make 

The test program can be used with one or two input arguments: if one input argument `x` is provided, then the test program simply calls `feval` with input `x` and prints the result. If a second input argument `yref` is provided, then the test program compares `yref` and the output of `feval`.

Submit your solution to Autolab when you are done testing your code.
