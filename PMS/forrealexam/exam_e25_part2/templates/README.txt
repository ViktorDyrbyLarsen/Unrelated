02635 Final exam (E25)

# TEMPLATES

The following files are templates for your answers:

    exam_e25_q1.c
    exam_e25_q2.c
    exam_e25_q3a.c
    exam_e25_q3b.c

Do not change the filenames. 

Your answers should not include a "main" function. You can hand in your 
answers as separate files, or you can use the included makefile to 
create a tar file:

    make handin

This creates a file "exam_e25_handin.tar" that includes the four files 
that you need to hand it.


# TEST PROGRAMS

The following templates may be used to implement your own tests and should 
not be handed in:

    test_q1.c
    test_q2.c
    test_q3a.c
    test_q3b.c

The test programs can be compiled using make, e.g., 

    make test_q1
